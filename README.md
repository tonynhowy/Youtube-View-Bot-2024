# Youtube-View-Bot-2024
A YouTube View Bot is a tool used to increase the number of views on a video artificially. These bots simulate real user behavior by watching videos, and some may also like, comment, or subscribe. The main purpose of using a view bot is to boost a video's popularity and visibility, making it appear more successful than it actually is.
